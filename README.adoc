== CardSimulation-Loader-swift

CardSimulation-Loader-swift is the Swift counter-part to the Java https://build.top.local/source/git/refImpl/tools/CardSimulation-Loader.git[CardSimulation-Loader] project.
The project serves as a (boot) loader for the G2-Kartensimulation.

=== Usage

The intented usage of this project is to ease integration and use of the G2-Kartensimulation with Swift projects. Specifically the Test-cases in these projects.
This guide is separated in two (2) main parts. Describing (1) the usage of the `CardSimulation-Loader` framework (How-to) and (2) describing how-to maintain and explain the technical consideration(s) and implementation(s).

==== Framework and Runner

The project has two (main) products. One (1) The *CardSimulationLoader.framework*
and the (2) executable *CardSimulationRunner*.
Our main focus is on the framework as this contains all the logic and functionality.
The runner is merely there to demonstrate/test the frameworks feature(s) and in
rare cases can be used as a stand-alone CardSimulation-runner. This runner keeps
monitoring the launched Java process for as long as either that process or its
own process is shut down.

===== CardSimulation-Loader

The sole purpose of this framework is to launch and monitor a G2-Kartensimulation Java process.
For detailed usage information see the inlined documentation on `SimulationManager`
and `SimulationRunner`.

*Starting the simulator*:

Of course the best way to find out how-to use the CardSimulation-Loader is by checking the `SimulationManagerTest` and `SimulationRunnerTest` to see their intended and tested use-cases.
Next to checking the test-cases you also find some (example) configuration files in the _Configuration.bundle_ [Tests/CardSimulationLoaderTests/Configuration.bundle].

In general you would prepare such a *card-configuration* XML as in the Configuration.bundle and pass it to the `SimulationManager.shared` by invoking its:
```Swift
startSimulation(
  configFile: URL,
  preprocessor manipulators: [XMLPathManipulator] = [],
  simulatorVersion: String = "2.7.6-352",
  simulatorDirectory: String = "simulator",
  waitUntilLaunched flag: Bool
)
```

Note: you can specify the G2-Kartensimulation version it needs to download/use.

The returned `SimulationRunnerType` can be used to monitor the newly started G2-Kartensimulation instance. To - for instance - figure out on which TLV-port the simulator is registered, just check the `SimulationRunnerType.mode`. When `running` the TLV TCP/IP port is projected there. And for convenience reasons made available through `var tlvPort: Int?` on SimulationRunnerType(s).

This SimulationRunnerType instance will need a CardTerminalControllerType (e.g. from https://build.top.local/source/git/refImpl/mobszen/iOS/CardSimulation-CardReaderProvider.git[CardTerminalControllerType]) to expose this G2-Kartensimulation virtual `HealthCard` to the HealthCardAccess/Control realm.

*Example*:

```Swift
/// Read configFile from included Resources Bundle
let simulatorConfig = Bundle(for: MyClass.self)
  .resourceFilePath(in: "Configuration", for: "configuration_EGKG2_80276883110000017222_gema5_TCP.xml")
  .asURL
/// Launch a G2-Kartensimulation with this configuration file
let runner = try SimulationManager.shared.startSimulation(
  configFile: simulatorConfig,
  preprocessor: [
    XMLPathManipulatorHolder.TLVPortManipulator(port: "0"),
    XMLPathManipulatorHolder.RelativeToAbsolutePathManipulator(with: XMLPathManipulatorHolder.CardConfigFileXMLPath, absolutePath: simulatorConfig.deletingLastPathComponent()),
    XMLPathManipulatorHolder.RelativeToAbsolutePathManipulator(with: XMLPathManipulatorHolder.ChannelConfigFileXMLPath, absolutePath: simulatorConfig.deletingLastPathComponent())
  ],
  waitUntilLaunched: true
)

... // Do amazing things with runner

/// Stop the runner when done
runner.stop(waitUntilTerminated: true)
```

=== Technical overview

As described in the previous section(s) the CardSimulationLoader provides an easy-to-use API to launch and manage a G2-Kartensimulation.
In order to achieve this we need to combine some various technologies/environments (read: Nexus <--> Java <--> Swift -> CardSimulationLoader API).
Along with a nice twist to the SwiftPM and xcodeproj collaboration with regards to the Resource bundles we know from xcodeproject files, but https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2866[apparently not exist] in the https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/master/Documentation/Resources.md[Swift world]).

The main components for this project to work:

* Download G2-Kartensimulation Nexus artifacts
* Launch and monitor Java Process

These two (2) steps are taken care of when using the `SimulationManager` to launch a simulation.

===== Maven step

The `SimulationManager` creates a transient `pom.xml` and executes a shell script to run `mvn dependency:copy-dependencies`.
And puts these artifacts in the same transient environment to be cleaned (manually) by calling `SimulationManager.clean` upon
finishing with the simulator(s). Reason for this is to not download the artifacts for every simulator instance in case they
are launch sequentially - which is reasonable to assume.

===== Java process

When the artifacts are in place, the `SimulationRunner` creates a JavaProcess that will be launched/forked in a separate process.
And monitors this process by reading/parsing the `stdout` and `stderr` to detect the tlv-port number and successful initialization.

To start developing the project follow the Project Setup section below ðŸ‘‡.

=== Getting Started

CardSimulationLoader requires Swift 5.1.

==== Setup for integration:

- **Carthage:** Put this in your `Cartfile`:

    github "gematik/CardReaderProvider-ApiKit" ~> 1.0

==== Setup for development

You will need https://bundler.io/[Bundler], https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen[XcodeGen]
and https://fastlane.tools[fastlane] to conveniently use the established development environment.

. Update ruby gems necessary for build commands
[source,Shell]
$ bundle install --path vendor/gems

. Checkout (and build) dependencies and generate the xcodeproject
[source,Shell]
$ bundle exec fastlane setup

. Build the project
[source,Shell]
$ bundle exec fastlane build_all [build_mac, build_ios]
